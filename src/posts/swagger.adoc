== Swagger Support for JAX-RS Applications

With the release of 1.0.0-Alpha8, WildFly Swarm has introduced support
for Swagger, a simple but powerful JSON representation of your REST
APIs.

In simple terms, Swagger is a JSON representation of a RESTful API,
typically made available over HTTP at `/swagger.json`. This JSON
document contains information about your APIs, including names, paths,
endpoints, parameters, descriptions, keywords, expected responses, and
more.

Per the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[Open API
Specification], the goal of Swagger is to "define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and
computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service
without access to source code, documentation, or through network
traffic inspection".

If this is your first encounter with Swagger, I suggest you head on
over to the http://swagger.io/[Swagger website] to learn more about
Swagger itself, and what it can do for you.

=== Usage

Using the Swagger fraction is quite simple. First, you'll need to enable
it in your application by adding it to your `pom.xml` file like so.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>swagger</artifactId>
    </dependency>

This causes WildFly Swarm to pull in all of the Swagger dependencies which
are subsequently bundled with your application in the `-swarm.jar` file.
The next thing you will need to do is add the Swagger annotations to your
JAX-RS resources.

=== Resource Annotations

In order to generate the `swagger.json` document, you will need to use
the Swagger annotations to declare properties of your API. The minimum
requirement here is the use of `@Api` and `@ApiOperation` to declare a
resource and an operation on that resource. Without at least these two
annotations present, no output will be generated for `swagger.json`.

From the Swagger documentation, here is an example of a `pet` resource
that has a single operation.

.Java PetResource.java
-----
@Path("/pet")
@Api(value = "pet", authorizations = {
      @Authorization(value="sampleoauth", scopes = {})
    })
@Produces({"application/json", "application/xml"})
public class PetResource {

     @GET
     @Path("/findByStatus")
     @ApiOperation(value = "Finds Pets by status",
        notes = "Multiple status values can be provided with comma seperated strings",
        response = Pet.class,
        responseContainer = "List")
     public Response findPetsByStatus() {
         // lookup...
     }
}
-----

These annotations would result in a `swagger.json` file which looks something like this:

.JSON swagger.json
----
{
  "/pet/findByStatus": {
  "get": {
    "tags": [
      "pet"
    ],
    "summary": "Finds Pets by status",
    "description": "Multiple status values can be provided with comma seperated strings",
    "responses": {
      "200": {
        "description": "successful operation",
        "schema": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/Pet"
          }
        }
      },
}
----

There is a lot that the Swagger annotations provide you for
documenting the details of your API. WildFly Swarm makes all of these
available to your application by simply including the `swagger`
fraction in your `pom.xml` as shown above. I highly recommend you take
a look at the
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X[Swagger
Annotations documentation] for more information on the Swagger annotations.

=== Configuration

The `swagger` fraction has reasonable defaults. Out of the box, zero configuration
is required. WildFly Swarm will examine your application, and have Swagger recursively
scan the top level package for JAX-RS resources. However, if you would like more
control of the configuration and want to customize the `swagger.json` output, you
can do this too. You'll need to provide a `Main.java` in your application, and
then use the ShrinkWrap API to customize the fraction configuration.

An example.

.JAVA Main.java
----

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        // Create a new container
        Container container = new Container();

        // Create a SwaggerArchive using ShrinkWrap API
        SwaggerArchive archive = ShrinkWrap.create(SwaggerArchive.class, "swagger-app.war");

        // Now we can use the SwaggerArchive to fully customize the JSON output
        archive.setVersion("1.0"); // our API version
        archive.setContact("Scott Tiger <scott@tiger.com>");  // set contact info
        archive.setLicense("MIT"); // set license

        // Finally tell swagger where our resources are
        archive.setResourcePackages("io.hipster.api.resources");


        // Make the SwaggerArchive JAX-RS friendly and add our api package
        JAXRSArchive deployment = archive.as(JAXRSArchive.class)
                                      .addPackage("io.hipster.api");


        // Make sure all dependencies are satisfied, and deploy that sucker
        deployment.addAllDependencies();
        container
                .fraction(LoggingFraction.createDefaultLoggingFraction())
                .start()
                .deploy(deployment);
    }
}
----

=== Swagger UI

The Swagger folks were nice enough to create an HTML5/CSS/JavaScript
client side application that can be used to document, query and
examine a Swagger capable API.  WildFly Swarm provides an easily
deployable and customizable version of this application via the
`swagger-ui` server.

You can grab the server from maven and run it out of the box like so.

    $ java -jar swagger-ui-1.0.0.Alpha9-SNAPSHOT-swarm.jar

The maven coordinates for this jar file are:

.XML
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm.servers</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger-ui</artifactId>
  <classifier>swarm</classifier>
</dependency>
----

The `swagger-ui` layout, colors and design are all pretty nice out of the
box. But of course it's customizable. If you want to change any of the
content served by `swagger-ui`, you can do this by providing a pointer to
it on the command line.

    $ java -jar swagger-ui-1.0.0.Alpha9-SNAPSHOT-swarm.jar ./my-custom-resources.jar

In this example, I'm providing a `.jar` file, but the command line argument
provided here can also be a path to a directory on disk, or even a GAV specifying
the maven coordinates of a published `.jar` or `.war` file.

The jar file provided (or the directory on disk) will be overlaid on
to the resources provided by `swagger-ui`. For example, to customize the
main page, provide an index.html file at the root of the jar or war
file, or in the top level of the directory provided. Here we are customizing
only the index.html file.

    $ jar tvf my-custom-project.jar
      0 Mon Feb 01 11:42:08 EST 2016 META-INF/
     68 Mon Feb 01 11:42:08 EST 2016 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
    312 Mon Feb 01 11:41:58 EST 2016 index.html

=== Conclusion and Caveats

So there you have it! Simple and straightforward support for Swagger
is now in WildFly Swarm. Yay!  But, the Swagger fraction is brand
spanking new, and we know there are shortcomings here and there. For example,
we are still working on supporting Swagger alongside CDI.

So, yeah, it's new and there may be creaks and groans as folks start
to try it out. Please feel free to provide feedback or ask questions
if you do. We're always happy to hear about experiences our community
is having. Talk to us on freenode at \#wildfly-swarm, or in our
