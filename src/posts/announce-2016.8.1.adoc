== We've reached 2016.8.1! Say what?!

Yes, we've released August.1!
There was a discussion on our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/thorntail/c7X3Rfjng6Q[Google Group] about six weeks ago regarding release naming,
and here we are releasing the first in the line of that new naming.

And yes, there was a problem with the original 2016.8, hence 2016.8.1!

Going forward we will be doing releases by month, unless we deem a month unworthy of a release.

With this release we've introduced multiple BOMs to signify maturity of the various parts.
See the section on _Fraction Stability indicator_ for further details.

And the JBoss Forge WildFly Swarm addon is also updated,
so feel free to https://github.com/forge/wildfly-swarm-addon/blob/master/README.asciidoc[give it a try]!

== What's New?

* MicroProfile
* Driver and Datasource handling
* CDI Configuration injection
* Fraction authoring changes
* Arquillian Testing changes
* Fraction Stability indicator
* GitHub reorganization
* Bugfixes

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WIldFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.

=== Microprofile

By now you've likely heard about the http://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] initiative that was announced at Red Hat Summit this year.
The goal of the MicroProfile is to optimize and enhance Java EE for a microservices architecture.
There are many challenges with microservices architecture that are not solved by Java EE, but the MicroProfile seeks to close that gap.

The initial version of MicroProfile, planned for September, defines it as containing JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P.
With this release WildFly Swarm now has support for the MicroProfile as a fraction.
To use it, just add the following to `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
  <version>2016.8.1</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Driver and Datasource handling

We've completely reworked how JDBC drivers, datasources and JPA interact to simplify it and remove a lot of the interdependencies between them.
We recognized that the previous means of configuring JDBC drivers, datasources and integrating them with JPA was not the easiest.
With this release we've split out the JDBC drivers into fractions for `h2`, `mysql` and `postgresql`.

With this change the JPA Fraction has a dependency on `h2` to get up and running quickly, but it doesn't contain any H2 specific configuration.
This makes it very easy to switch between JDBC drivers by excluding the `h2` dependency from `jpa` and adding a dependency for a different driver.

All the existing configuration properties haven't changed and work as before.

=== CDI Configuration injection

This change breaks backwards compatibility, unfortunately, as we've renamed `@ConfigValue` to `@ConfigurationValue`.
Configuration values are also now injectable into Fractions or user application code!

=== Fraction authoring changes

Developing fractions is now a whole lot simpler!

Only a single Maven module is now required for a Fraction, with any complexity moved into the fraction-plugin for packaging it.

Full details are available in the https://wildfly-swarm.gitbooks.io/wildfly-swarm-users-guide/content/v/8cca257df347646706d7967e93f0588bc75681a9/fraction_authoring.html[User Guide].

=== Arquillian Testing changes

We've simplified how to do testing with Arquillian in this release.

There is no longer a need to have the test implement `ContainerFactory`, etc.
All you need is to define a `Swarm` instance like this:

[source,java]
----
@CreateSwarm
public static Swarm newContainer() throws Exception {
    return new Swarm().fraction(EJBFraction.createDefaultFraction());
}
----

=== Fraction stability indicators

You may have noticed in the http://wildfly-swarm.io/generator/[Project Generator] that we now display stability badges
that indicate the level of maturity for each Fraction.
The table below outlines what the different stability levels mean:

|=====================
| Level | BOMs | Description

| Deprecated
| bom-deprecated, bom-all
| Expect no more changes. Avoid using this fraction.

| Experimental
| bom-experimental, bom-all
| Expect the unexpected. Please provide feedback on API and your use-case

| Unstable
| bom-unstable, bom-all
| Expect patches and features, possible API changes.

| Stable
| bom, bom-stable, bom-all
| Expect patches, possible features additions.

| Frozen
| bom-frozen, bom-all
| Expect only patches. Please do not make feature requests.

| Locked
| bom-locked, bom-all
| Expect no changes, except serious bugs. Please do not make feature requests.
|=====================

=== GitHub reorganization

After splitting out the codebase into several repositories a few releases ago, after 1.0.0.Final we've merged them all together again!

There are still a couple of repositories, fraction-plugin and spi, that are still separate but the rest is all in https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm.
We've been able to merge them together by simplifying what is required to develop a Fraction, thereby reducing the number of Maven poms required.

DonÂ´t be afraid to star it! :)

=== Bugfixes

There are quite a few bugs fixed in this release since 1.0.0.Final.
Check out the full list of them below in the changelog.
