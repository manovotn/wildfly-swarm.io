After some hearty discussion at our face-to-face meeting in Newcastle, UK,
along with continuing that discussion on our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thorntail[Google Group],
we've decided to split apart our monolithic repository into reasonable slices.

Part of the motivation for this split is related to how we version things.  Since
WildFly Swarm is a fairly quickly-moving project, at least in the near term,
there would always be some components in `alpha` or `beta` phase, preventing
the entirety from being released as `final`.  Especially given that WildFly Swarm
is an integration project, the upstream components we integrate with all have
varying release schedules, and timing a collective release can be difficult.

To that end, each of the repositories below is roughly linked with its
upstream components and can produce independently-versioned bits of
WildFly Swarm.  Now, a release of *WildFly Swarm* will actually be composed
of a matrix of releases of the various sub-components, not necessarily matching
in version numbering.

Since a multitude of versions can certainly make life more difficult for
consumers, we've added a BOM strategy (see _Practical Changes_ below).

== The New Bits

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm[wildfly-swarm]

The collective aggregating BOM project which represents the publicly-versioned
collective of all other independently-versioned bits that make up a release
of _WildFly Swarm_

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-parent[wildfly-swarm-parent]

This repository contains the root `pom.xml` used as a parent POM for all other
things.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-core[wildfly-swarm-core]

This repository contains 80% of the bits that used to live in the monolithic
repository.  It consists of `bootstrap`, `container` and most anything
that we get from upstream WildFly, including `jax-rs` (and its variants),
`undertow`, `infinispan` and `jsf`.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-netflix[wildfly-swarm-netflix]

This repository contains the bits to support Ribbon, Hystrix, etc, from NetflixOSS.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-logstash[wildfly-swarm-logstash]

This repository contains the Logstash components for using the ELK stack with
your applications.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-jolokia[wildfly-swarm-jolokia]

This repository contains the Jolokia fraction to easily add Jolokia to your
applications.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-swagger[wildfly-swarm-swagger]

This repository contains the application adapter to expose `swagger.json` along
with the `swagger-webapp` for serving the fancy UI.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-topology[wildfly-swarm-topology]

This repository contains the SPI for our topology infrastructure.  Typically not
used directly (unless you're attempting to add another topology implementation.)

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-topology-webapp[wildfly-swarm-topology-webapp]

This repository contains the Javascript/web-app portion for exposing the topology
to the browser.  This *may* become merged with the repository above in short order.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-topology-jgroups[wildfly-swarm-topology-jgroups]

This repository contains the topology implementation based upon WildFly's JGroups
subsystem.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-topology-consul[wildfly-swarm-topology-consul]

This repository contains the topology implementation based upon Hashicorp's
Consul registry.

=== http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-servers[wildfly-swarm-servers]

This repository contains projects for constructing ready-to-use
`-swarm.jar` versions of servers for `keycloak` and `swagger-ui`.

== Practical Changes

As mentioned in the introduction above, we now provide a BOM which can completely
eliminate headaches involved in multiple components having multiple versions.

To use our BOM, simply add the following to your own POM:

  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
        <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
        <version>${version.wildfly.swarm}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>

Once you have done this, you can avoid having to specify any other `<version>`
tags for any _WildFly Swarm_-related components.

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

Our http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples[wildfly-swarm-examples] repository
makes use of the BOM now.
